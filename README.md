# imd/acc

**Trading cashback in staked IMD.** Every trade in a participating project sends part of the trade, between 0.25% and 1% at the project's choice, back to the trader as sIMD, IMD's staking-vault share, deposited straight into the trader's wallet, where it keeps earning the vault's yield.

Live listing trials, 2026-10-12: on test run 4, PLEA listed (11 of 12) and defended (11 of 11); on test run 5, under the version 3 rules, the negative case rejected 11 to 0 and a compliant trial venue listed (11 of 14) and defended (11 of 12), bond to its beneficiary ([history, sections 29 and 39 to 41](docs/history.md#41-test-run-5-trial-complete-the-trialvenue-defended-a-clearer-trader-rule-drafted-2026-10-12)). On test run 6 (rules version 3.1), the same venue listed 11 of 11 and defended 11 of 11, no split ([history, section 44](docs/history.md#44-test-run-6-trial-the-trialvenue-listed-11-of-11-2026-10-13)).

## Why imd/acc

- **No new token.** The cashback is IMD, staked. There is nothing else to buy.
- **No custody.** imd/acc never holds the cashback. The vault mints the shares directly to the trader.
- **No extra fee.** Projects pay the cashback out of fees they already charge, so traders pay nothing on top and projects don't have to add a new fee.
- **Each project picks its rate,** from 0.25% to 1% of each trade. Projects with thin fees can still join; others can offer more to attract traders. PLEA pays 0.5%.
- **No owner.** The shared contract has no admin, no fee, no pause and no upgrade.

## How it works

```
 trader ── trades ──► project's pool and hook
                          │  takes its rate (0.25%–1%) of the trade in IMD, out of its own fee
                          ▼
              Stacker.credit(trader, amount)
                          │  pulls the IMD from the project
                          ▼
              sIMD.deposit(amount, trader) ──► sIMD shares minted to the trader
                          │
                          └─► event Stacked(project, trader, imd, shares) ──► points
```

1. A trader trades in a participating pool, for example PLEA/IMD.
2. The project's hook takes its cashback rate (0.25%–1%) of the trade on the IMD side, so IMD-paired pools need no extra swap.
3. The hook calls `Stacker.credit(trader, amount)`. The Stacker pulls the IMD and deposits it into the sIMD vault with the trader as the receiver.
4. The trader's sIMD balance goes up. Withdrawals and redemptions are blocked in any block in which the vault mints them positive shares (the vault's one-block hold); transfers also carry the sender's hold forward. Anyone can renew a trader's hold with a tiny deposit, including a 1-wei IMD `credit`, or by depositing directly into sIMD. An exit therefore needs a block without a renewed hold; it is not guaranteed to succeed in the next block. This is a property of the existing vault, whose owner has renounced.

## The Stacker contract

One shared contract that every project calls.

```solidity
function credit(address trader, uint256 imdAmount) external returns (uint256 shares);
event Stacked(address indexed project, address indexed trader, uint256 imd, uint256 shares);
```

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Project | `msg.sender`. Any contract or wallet can call `credit`; [points](#points) decide who counts. |
| Flow | Pulls `imdAmount` IMD from the caller, then calls `sIMD.deposit(imdAmount, trader)`. |
| Holds nothing | `credit` leaves 0 IMD and 0 sIMD in the Stacker (tested as an invariant). Do not send tokens directly to it: unsolicited transfers cannot be recovered. |
| Fixed | IMD and sIMD addresses are immutable. The constructor only stores them and makes no external call (an IMD launch rule); the first non-zero `credit` checks `sIMD.asset() == IMD` and approves the vault once, and a failed credit rolls both back. |
| Totals on chain | Per project (`projectStacked`, `projectShares`) and in total (`totalStacked`). |
| Per trader | From the `Stacked` events, which record project, trader, IMD and shares for every credit. Storing them on chain too would cost every trader extra gas, so the mainnet Stacker doesn't. |
| Failures | Reverts and moves nothing if the vault is paused, the allowance or balance is short, the trader is zero (`ZeroTrader`), the trader is the Stacker, IMD token or the vault itself (`InvalidTrader`), or the vault would mint 0 shares. A 0 amount with a valid trader returns 0 with no event. |
| Safety | `nonReentrant`, OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20`, no owner or admin functions at all. |

Source: [`src/Stacker.sol`](src/Stacker.sol), the contract live on Ethereum mainnet since launch #1409: the Sepolia test run 2 Stacker (launch #1294) plus the mainnet audit's check that refuses the Stacker, the vault and the IMD token as the trader (`InvalidTrader`), with its tests ([history, section 33](docs/history.md#33-mainnet-stacker-live-launch-1409-2026-10-12)). The first Sepolia Stacker (launch #1129) also stored per-trader totals on chain (`traderStacked`, `stackedBy`, `traderShares`).

## Deployments

Every deployment below was built, audited and deployed by the IMD swarm in a paid job; the jobs, launches, delivered code and audit findings are listed in [docs/launches.md](docs/launches.md) and on the site's Docs page "Launches & audits".

### Sepolia (live, launch #1129, block 11,874,601)

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TestIMD | [`0x2b69099e59b05901faa1dd164fabf098bf831e82`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2b69099e59b05901faa1dd164fabf098bf831e82) | Test IMD. `faucet()` gives 10,000 tIMD per address every 24h. |
| TestSIMD | [`0xf9e2eec3b610ec6781f7438ac5fb4bc049d81cc1`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xf9e2eec3b610ec6781f7438ac5fb4bc049d81cc1) | A copy of the real sIMD vault. Its owner can pause it, so integrators can test their fallback. |
| Stacker | [`0x293c7134ab8f6bf1d8ff44ed806575f8f1baf477`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x293c7134ab8f6bf1d8ff44ed806575f8f1baf477) | The imd/acc contract. |

Test page: https://imd-acc-sepolia-test-run.site.identitymd.eth.limo. It shows your stack, the leaderboards, the faucet and a "stack to myself" tool.

### Sepolia test run 2 (live, launch #1294, block 11,891,109)

Same TestIMD and TestSIMD as above. Code: [launch-1294 repository](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1294-deploy-two-smart-contracts), commit `ef39dd18`. IMD's audit changed both contracts slightly before deploying ([history, section 11](docs/history.md#11-test-run-2-launch-job-imd-changed-the-contracts-2026-10-11)); `main` carries those changes since 2026-10-12, and its registry also has the clearer panel rules (version 2), which the deployed Sepolia registry doesn't.

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stacker | [`0x0457276d7b036818b3eddc1a4a3fceda61e9314d`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x0457276d7b036818b3eddc1a4a3fceda61e9314d) | The new Stacker: per-project totals on chain, per-trader figures from events. It checks and approves the vault on its first credit. |
| ProjectRegistry | [`0x3a3bfcb65614292b0ec7c62f9e3a5dac003b920e`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x3a3bfcb65614292b0ec7c62f9e3a5dac003b920e) | The oracle-decided list. Fee `ORACLE_FEE()` (0.5 test IMD of `0x44a1…f89a`, read live from Intake v2), challenge bond 5 test IMD, cooldown 1 hour, panel 15/11. Challenges use `challengeForBeneficiary(project, reason, expectedBeneficiary)`. |

Test site: https://imd-acc-sepolia-test-run-2.sites.imd.fun/, one page each for Home (`#/`), Your stack (`#/stack`), Projects (`#/projects`, and `#/projects/<address>` per project), Apply (`#/apply`), Leaderboard (`#/leaderboard`) and Docs (`#/docs/<section>`), plus agent text at [`/llms.txt`](https://imd-acc-sepolia-test-run-2.sites.imd.fun/llms.txt). Built by jobs [`6`](jobs/6-sepolia-v2-site.md) and [`7`](jobs/7-sepolia-v2-site-pages.md); checked in a browser on every page ([history, section 16](docs/history.md#16-test-run-2-site-v2-live-and-checked-2026-10-11)).

### Sepolia test run 3 (live, launch #1371, block 11,897,213)

The registry `main` will use on mainnet (panel rules version 2, one beneficiary handoff per day), with Sepolia settings, wired to test run 2's Stacker above, which was not redeployed. Code: [launch-1371 repository](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1371-launch-imd-acc-s-third-last), commit `e6a9e072`; its `src/` is byte for byte `main`'s ([history, section 24](docs/history.md#24-sepolia-test-run-3-live-launch-1371-2026-10-12)).

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ProjectRegistry | [`0x9b466d1527322435dc7fdd97bc862b49c177fc2d`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9b466d1527322435dc7fdd97bc862b49c177fc2d) | Stacker `0x0457…314d`, fee `ORACLE_FEE()` 0.5 test IMD of `0x44a1…f89a` (read live from Intake v2), challenge bond 5 test IMD, cooldown 1 hour, panel 15/11, 1-day expiry, beneficiary handoff at most once per day. Challenges use `challengeForBeneficiary(project, reason, expectedBeneficiary)`. |

The test run 2 site still reads test run 2's registry.

### Sepolia test run 4 (live, launch #1378, block 11,897,725)

The registry `main` will use on mainnet, now with owed bonds (a bond the token refuses to pay never holds a question open; its recipient takes it with `claimBond(to)`), with Sepolia settings, wired to test run 2's Stacker above. Code: [launch-1378 repository](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1378-launch-imd-acc-s-fourth-last), commit `666e7b63`; its `src/` is byte for byte `main`'s ([history, section 26](docs/history.md#26-sepolia-test-run-4-live-launch-1378-2026-10-12)). Source verified on Sourcify (full match). The live trial ran on this registry: PLEA is listed from block 11,898,188 and was defended against a challenge; SelfCredit was rejected ([history, section 29](docs/history.md#29-live-listing-trial-on-the-test-run-4-registry-plea-listed-and-defended-2026-10-12)).

Challenges use `challengeForBeneficiary(project, reason, expectedBeneficiary)`. |

### Sepolia test run 5 (live, launch #1428, block 11,899,694)

The registry `main` will use on mainnet: test run 4's plus version 3 of the panel rules (the trader is router `hookData`, else the router's `msgSender()`, never a router; LP fees don't count toward the fee guard) and owner-only applications (a project that reports an `owner()` is applied for by that owner or itself), with Sepolia settings, wired to test run 2's Stacker. Code: [launch-1428 repository](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1428-launch-imd-acc-s-sepolia-test), commit `9062c14a`; its `src/` is byte for byte `main`'s ([history, section 38](docs/history.md#38-sepolia-test-run-5-live-launch-1428-2026-10-12)). Source verified on Sourcify. Live trial: SelfCredit rejected 11 to 0; the TrialVenue listed from block 11,900,332 and defended ([history, sections 39 to 41](docs/history.md#41-test-run-5-trial-complete-the-trialvenue-defended-a-clearer-trader-rule-drafted-2026-10-12)).

### Sepolia test run 6 (live, launch #1463, block 11,900,978)

The registry `main` will use on mainnet: test run 5's with version 3.1 of the panel rules (the `trader` rule rejects the router itself and says a contract the router's `msgSender()` reports is a valid trader; rehearsed 11 of 11, [panel-rules-v2.md](docs/panel-rules-v2.md#version-31-the-trader-rule-made-precise-2026-10-12)), with Sepolia settings, wired to test run 2's Stacker. The website, the data API and the test tools use this registry.

### Robinhood Chain (live, launch #1537, block 87,379,080)

The multichain route ([design](docs/design.md#multichain-cashback-from-other-chains)): a **RemoteStacker** on Robinhood Chain (chain 4663) with the same `credit(trader, imdAmount)`, whose waiting cashback anyone can `flush` to Ethereum through IMD's own LayerZero bridge for a tip of up to 2%, and a **StackReceiver** on Ethereum (launch #1529, table below) that deposits each delivery into the sIMD vault for its trader. Both are live since 2026-10-13 and the route was tested live the same day: two flushes from Robinhood Chain reached the sIMD vault on Ethereum within about two minutes each ([history, section 52](docs/history.md#52-the-multichain-route-tested-live-robinhood-chain-to-the-simd-vault-twice-2026-10-13)). Next: a Robinhood Chain ProjectRegistry.

Sends to the StackReceiver `0x1999…3d10` on Ethereum (eid 30101). The pinned code plus IMD's audit fixes (Ethereum's IMD and endpoint refused as traders; the waiting clock rounded in the trader's favour), delivered to [launch-1537](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1537-launch-imd-acc-s-remotestacker-robinhood) (commit `4cfaa55d`) ([history, section 51](docs/history.md#51-robinhood-chain-remotestacker-live-launch-1537-2026-10-13)).

The IMD swarm's audit added one check to `credit`: the Stacker, the vault and the IMD token are refused as the trader (`InvalidTrader`), since shares there could never move. Delivered to the [launch-1409 repository](https://github.com/identity-md-launches/launch-1409-launch-imd-acc-ethereum-mainnet) (commit `e07f102f`); `src/Stacker.sol` here is that code ([history, section 33](docs/history.md#33-mainnet-stacker-live-launch-1409-2026-10-12)).

The Ethereum end of the [multichain route](docs/design.md#multichain-cashback-from-other-chains): the LayerZero endpoint `0x1a44…728c` hands it each bridged delivery and it deposits every listed amount into sIMD for its trader.

## Points

Every `Stacked` event is kept as a record. Points are the basis for the leaderboards and maybe a later airdrop; **nothing is promised**.

- **Trader points:** 1 point per IMD stacked for the trader. A project with a higher rate gives its traders more cashback, so more points.
- **Project points:** the IMD its traders stacked.
- **Rate and guard:** each listing records the rate the project applied with (0.25%–1%). A project may change its rate later, as long as it stays between 0.25% and 1%. To list, the part of the project's fee that really leaves for good (burns, liquidity locked forever, prizes to others; LP fees don't count, since the trader may be the liquidity provider) must be at least as large as its cashback, at every rate and fee split its code allows, so trading with yourself to farm points always costs more than it brings back. Credits outside 0.25%–1% of their trade earn no points.
- **Listed projects only.** Anyone can call `credit` with their own IMD; that's just staking for someone, so it earns no points. Only credits from a listed project count, from the block it was listed (`fromBlock`), never before.
- **Who is listed:** from Sepolia test run 2, an on-chain **ProjectRegistry** decides, with no owner: the project's owner applies with `applyListing` (anyone, for a project without an owner), an IdentityMD oracle panel answers yes or no against the rules, and anyone can challenge a listed project with a bond. Where no registry runs yet, a list file per chain in this repository is used instead. Steps, checklist, fee guard and delisting: [docs/listing.md](docs/listing.md).
- **How they're counted:** by adding up the `Stacked` events, which can't be changed or deleted. An indexer keeps the totals ready for the site; project totals are also on chain.

**What a trader sees on the dashboard**, with no visit to the vault's site:

| Figure | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| Cashback received, points, split per project | their `Stacked` events |
| sIMD held now | the vault, live |
| What their cashback is worth today | the shares in their events, priced by the vault, live |
| Earned on top (vault yield) | worth today − cashback received |

The all-traders dashboard and leaderboards (top traders, top projects, 7-day and 30-day views) come from the same events.

| Project | Status |
|---|---|
| PLEA v10 (hook `0x3d4C…68Cc`, first Stacker) | Not listed. Its listing job for the first test page ([`jobs/3-list-plea.md`](jobs/3-list-plea.md)) is no longer needed, since test run 2 replaces that page. |
| PLEA, next version (hook `0x2d5a…a8cc`, Stacker of test run 2) | **Listed** on the test run 4 registry at 50 bps from block 11,898,188 (2026-10-12, signed yes 11 of 12), and defended against a challenge (11 of 11). Not yet applied to test run 5's registry: its sell fallback to `sender` fails the version 3 trader rule, and PLEA's next hook (branch `testnet4`: hookData, else the router's `msgSender()`) is not deployed yet; the site and data API now count points on test run 5's registry. (On test run 2's registry, with the version 1 rules, its two applications split the panel.) |
| imd/acc TrialVenue (`0xf252…6fef`, Sepolia, [`test/trial/TrialVenue.sol`](test/trial/TrialVenue.sol)) | **Listed** on the test run 6 registry at 50 bps from block 11,902,743 (2026-10-13, signed yes 11 of 11, the first listing under rules version 3.1) and defended against a challenge there (11 of 11); earlier listed on test run 5 (11 of 14) and defended (11 of 12). The trial's positive case: a small IMD/TRIAL pool with locked liquidity that credits 0.5% and burns 0.5% of each trade's fee. |

## Integrating a project

```solidity
// Once: let the Stacker pull IMD from your contract.
IERC20(imd).approve(address(stacker), type(uint256).max);

// On each supported trade, with the real trader resolved and validated under rule 3:
uint256 cashback = imdSideAmount * RATE_BPS / 10_000;        // your rate: 25-100 bps (0.25%-1%), out of your fee
// At the call site: fund even the first-ever credit and retain gas for the fallback.
require(gasleft() >= 410_000, "imd/acc: insufficient gas");
try stacker.credit{gas: 350_000}(trader, cashback) {
    // the trader now holds the sIMD
} catch {
    IERC20(imd).transfer(trader, cashback);                  // plain IMD: the trade never reverts
}
```

Rules:
1. **Fund it from your fee.** Pick a rate from 0.25% to 1% and take it on the IMD side of the trade, out of the fee you already charge. The part of your fee that leaves for good (burns, liquidity locked forever, prizes to others, third-party payments) must be at least as large as the cashback at every allowed setting, or the listing is refused. LP fees don't count: the trader may be the liquidity provider.
2. **Never let imd/acc break a trade.** Wrap `credit` in `try/catch` and pay plain IMD if it fails.
3. **Pay the real trader.** First decode valid trader data using the router's agreed `hookData` encoding. Otherwise, during the swap, try `IMsgSender(sender).msgSender()`; use `sender` itself only when it has no code. Never use `tx.origin` or substitute a forwarding router for an unresolved trader. Bound and catch the accessor call; reject failed, malformed, zero or self-referential results. Validate every recipient: zero, the Stacker, the IMD token, the vault and the router itself are invalid destinations. The address `msgSender()` reports is a valid trader even when it is a contract (a smart-contract wallet), as is one named in valid trader data. With invalid nonempty data, pay plain IMD to a valid independently resolved caller; if `credit` fails, pay plain IMD to the same valid resolved trader. If no valid trader can be resolved, skip the cashback branch without blocking the trade or sending either token to the router; that route must provide trader data before cashback is enabled. Such skipped payouts earn no points and must not be advertised as supported cashback.
4. **Check gas before the call.** Require enough gas for `credit` up front and revert if it's short. Otherwise a wallet's gas estimate picks the cheaper path without cashback, and traders get plain IMD. PLEA learned this on Sepolia. The example always forwards 350k gas, including on the first-ever credit, with a 410k `gasleft()` check immediately before the call. The extra 60k allows for call overhead, EIP-150's forwarding limit and the plain-IMD fallback. Increase the reserve for any remaining work in your hook, and test the complete trade. Keep this check outside `try/catch`; a failed credit is caught, an underfunded transaction must be estimated again.
5. **Budget the gas.** Reference costs of `credit` (whole transactions, before the mainnet recipient guard; rounded):

   | Network | First-ever credit | New trader after initialization | Repeat trader |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Ethereum mainnet (fork, block 26,173,849) | 232k | 136k | 102k |
   | Sepolia (the launch #1129 Stacker; per-trader storage) | not measured | 0.7M–1.2M | about 0.2M |

   The first successful non-zero credit also validates `sIMD.asset()` and establishes the Stacker's vault approval. A 177k cap derived from 136k ×1.3 runs out of gas on a fresh Stacker, rolls back initialization, and can keep every later trade on plain IMD. These receipt costs are not safe call-gas caps: refunds, cold accesses, and a project's first credit affect the gas needed during execution. The 350k call budget above is tested against both the local vault copy and the live mainnet pair, including a cold first credit. Wallets should send estimates ×1.3 for the complete trade, after the hook enforces its gas check; do not reduce the first-credit budget to the new-trader figure.
6. **For Uniswap v4 hooks:** include the `afterSwap` logic Uniswap's frontend whitelisting expects, resolve the router's `msgSender()` as required by rule 3 (including empty `hookData`), and warn users about copycat v2/v3 pools. These are btc/acc's lessons.
7. **Test the failure path** on Sepolia: TestSIMD's owner can pause it, and your hook should then pay plain IMD.

In v4, the hook's `sender` is the caller of PoolManager, commonly a router; it is not necessarily the trader ([Uniswap hook calls](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/src/libraries/Hooks.sol)). Universal Router exposes the active caller through [`msgSender()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/universal-router/blob/main/contracts/base/Dispatcher.sol), and tokens paid to the router can be taken through its [sweep command](https://github.com/Uniswap/universal-router/blob/main/contracts/modules/Payments.sol). [`test/TraderResolution.t.sol`](test/TraderResolution.t.sol) reproduces that loss and exercises the corrected resolution and fallback with a minimal router model; its packed 20-byte trader format is an example, not a universal `hookData` format.

## Projects

| Project | Chain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **PLEA**: a sell-gated meme token on Uniswap v4 | Ethereum (Sepolia first) | **Live on Sepolia, listed.** Its hook credits 0.5% (its rate) of every PLEA/IMD trade inside the same swap, for buys and sells; its current hook `0x2d5a…a8cc` is listed on the test run 4 registry, so its credits earn points. PLEA mainnet will use the mainnet Stacker. |
| **PondPad**: an IMD-paired launchpad | Robinhood Chain | Planned. The sIMD vault is on Ethereum only, so PondPad uses the [multichain route](docs/design.md#multichain-cashback-from-other-chains): cashback waits on Robinhood Chain and is delivered to Ethereum as sIMD through IMD's own bridge. |

## Roadmap

1. **Sepolia test run 2:** the new Stacker and the ProjectRegistry on the live test pair, with a new test page, in one order. PLEA's next version then credits through the Stacker and applies to the registry. [`jobs/5-sepolia-v2-launch.md`](jobs/5-sepolia-v2-launch.md)
2. **Deploy the Stacker on Ethereum mainnet** from this repository, with a full audit by the IMD swarm. PLEA mainnet needs its address. [`jobs/4-mainnet-launch.md`](jobs/4-mainnet-launch.md)
3. **Indexer and mainnet dashboard:** the events kept in a fast table, then the site with each trader's cashback, points and value, and the leaderboards.
4. **Multichain:** Robinhood Chain first (PondPad), then Base and Arbitrum. Cashback waits per trader on that chain and goes to Ethereum through IMD's own LayerZero bridge, paid by a small tip ([design](docs/design.md#multichain-cashback-from-other-chains)). Contracts built and tested on forks of both chains (2026-10-13); launches next: the StackReceiver on Ethereum (job 14), the RemoteStacker on Robinhood Chain (job 15), then a registry there.
5. **v2: the ETH route** for projects whose fees are in ETH. `creditETH(trader)` records pending ETH; a public `flush()` swaps the batch to IMD through POOL4 behind a TWAP price guard, deposits it and splits the shares. Built once such a project wants in.
6. **ProjectRegistry on mainnet** (done, launch #1495): the same contract, with a 20 IMD challenge bond and a 7-day cooldown ([design](docs/design.md#settings)).

Open questions (with recommendations) are in the [design notes](docs/design.md#open-questions): an sIMD vault on Robinhood Chain, and cashback on sells as well as buys.

## Build and test

With [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) 1.8.3, the version IMD's verifier runs:

```
forge build
forge test                                                        # 292 tests; the 20 fork tests skip
ETH_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com forge test --mc MainnetFork            # live IMD and sIMD
ETH_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com forge test --mc StackReceiverMainnetFork # the live endpoint delivers to the receiver
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com forge test --mc SepoliaFork # live TestIMD and TestSIMD; RegistrySepoliaFork: the real Intake v2
ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL=https://robinhood-rpc.publicnode.com forge test --mc RobinhoodFork   # a real send-and-call through the live IMD OFT
forge fmt --check src test
```

The mainnet fork tests check the live vault's facts (asset, renounced owner, not paused), a credit to a new and a repeat trader, and the one-block hold followed by a redeem. The Sepolia ones check a credit, its event and totals, and that a paused vault makes `credit` revert without moving anything; the registry's fork test sends a real application to Intake v2 and settles it. The multichain fork tests play a bridge arrival on Ethereum exactly as the live contracts do (IMD's `lzReceive`, then the endpoint's `lzCompose` into the StackReceiver) and send a real send-and-call from a RemoteStacker through Robinhood Chain's live IMD.

**Branches:** `main`'s `launch.json` is the next mainnet launch's manifest: the StackReceiver, on the live IMD, sIMD and LayerZero endpoint (job 14). The `sepolia` branch differs only in `launch.json` (test run 6's registry, wired to the live Sepolia Stacker). `launch-mainnet` and `launch-sepolia` are those two without `.github/workflows`, for IMD's launches; never merge them back. A `robinhood` branch (and `launch-robinhood`) will carry the RemoteStacker's manifest once the receiver's address is known.

**Working with IMD:** jobs are paid in IMD (0.5 IMD each) from the owner's wallet. Run the free `POST https://api.imd.fun/requests/check` before paying. Set hosting only with the job's `ipfs` field, never in the prompt text, or the agent tries to publish the site itself and blocks. Docs: https://imd.fun/docs.

## Data API

Read-only JSON files with every chain's cashback and points, rebuilt from the chain about every 15 minutes and published with the website: start at https://imdacc.fun/data/v1/index.json. Points follow the listing periods of the chain's registry, and every file is checked against the Stacker's own totals before it is published. Format, rules and stability promise: [docs/data-api.md](docs/data-api.md). Builder: [`tools/snapshot/`](tools/snapshot/build.mjs).

## Credits

imd/acc is inspired by **[btc/acc](https://www.token.works/archive/btcacc)** by **[TokenWorks](https://www.token.works)** (February 2025). btc/acc was a Uniswap v4 hook that took 1% of each trade on the trader's behalf, bought them Bitcoin (cbBTC) and kept it for them in its protocol, so traders built a Bitcoin position just by trading.

imd/acc takes the same idea into the IMD ecosystem: the cashback is staked IMD instead of Bitcoin, and it comes out of fees projects already charge instead of a new 1% on top. That second change answers a lesson TokenWorks wrote up themselves: apps rarely add a fee that only benefits their users. Their notes on Uniswap's frontend whitelisting, router `msgSender` support and copycat pools shaped the integration rules above.

imd/acc is an independent project, not made by TokenWorks. Thank you to TokenWorks for building btc/acc in the open and writing up what they learned.
